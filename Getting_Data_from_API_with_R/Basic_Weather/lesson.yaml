  Course: Getting the Data from API with R
  Lesson: Basic Weather
  Author: Yizhe Xu
  Type: Standard
  Organization: aWhere
  Version: 1.0
  
- Class: text
  Output: This lesson is about accessing aWhere API to download 2 weeks worth of weather data for any given location and any given start date. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: Retrieving data from the API has 4 steps. First, is to get API authorization. aWhere uses OAuth 2.0 tokens to regulate access to the API. You should be provided with a Key and Secret. 
#  with which you will generate an Access Token to be included on each API request. 

- Class: text
  Output: The second step is to set up API querying string. The string is the url behind the GET function in Postman. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: The third step is to send the query string through a GET command to the api. 
 
- Class: text
  Output: The last step is to format the data and export it into a format you would like to use. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of the following statement is wrong?
  AnswerChoices: If I don't know my API credentials then I cannot get data from the API; To query the data, I need to build a query string first; After sending a query string, I can directly use the weather data; After sending a query string, the data need to be formated and exported into a format of my choice for me to use. 
  CorrectAnswer: After sending a query string, I can directly use the weather data
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 'After sending a query string, I can directly use the weather data')
  Hint: "Remember the 4 steps are: get API credential; build query string, send query string, and format/export the data. "

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Do you know your API Key and Secret to access the api?
  AnswerChoices: Yes; No
  CorrectAnswer: 'Yes'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 'Yes')
  Hint: Valid API credentials are required to access aWhere API service. Please contact aWhere trainer for the API credentials. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: "Now we want to tell R the API key and Secret, so that R can use it later to retrieve data from the API. R stores data (value) in different variables. We need to assign the API key and API credential to two different variables: 'api_key', and 'api_secret'. "
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'The way you assign a value to a variable in R is by using the assignment operator, which is just a ''less than'' symbol followed by a ''minus'' sign. It looks like this: <-' 
  # credit: Nick Carchedi, R Programming: Basic Building Blocks
  
- Class: text
  Output: You can assign anything to a variable. Such as a result of a calculation (x <- 1 + 1), a number (x <- 100, x <- pi), a character (x <- "great"), a logical value (x <- TRUE). In R, these objects together are called Atomic Vectors. Except for Atomic Vectors, R also has Matrix, List, Data frame, and Array. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: An API key is a character vector. To assign this to variable api_key, you just need to type API key in quotes and assign it to api_key using <-. Now, assign API key to api_key. 
  AnswerTests: expr_creates_var("api_key")
  Hint: Enter api_key <- "Your API Key"
  # consider a demo account
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Check out the API key you assigned to api_key by entering api_key.
  CorrectAnswer: api_key
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='api_key')
  Hint: Just type api_key
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now assign the API secret to api_secret. 
  AnswerTests: expr_creates_var("api_secret")
  Hint: Enter api_secret <- "Your API Secret"
  
- Class: text
  Output: After setting up API authentication, now you can prepare a query string to retrieve data from the API. 

- Class: text
  Output: "According to aWhere Weather Kit API Documentation, there are 3 required request parameters: the latitude, longitude, and a startDate. This set of parameters will give you 14 days worth of data (14 historical days or at most 8 days forecasting). The data will have 3 weather variables: max temperature, min temperature, precipitation. "
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of the following statement about basic weather query is wrong?
  AnswerChoices: Basic weather query require location and start date as input parameters; If using current date as start date to do basic weather query, I will get 14 days worth of data but only 8 days will have actual data; Through basic weather query you can get data for any weather variables; Basic weather query only allows one location and one start date per query. 
  CorrectAnswer: 'Through basic weather query you can get data for any weather variables'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 'Through basic weather query you can get data for any weather variables')
  Hint: Basic weather query can get max temperature, min temperature, and precipitation data from one location with 14 days worth of historical data or 8 days worth of forecasting data. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: The first is the latitude. In this exercise, we will be querying weather information for Julius Nyerere International Airport in Dar es Salaam.  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Similarly, we also need to assign the value of latitude and longitude to two different variables. The latitude is a number (numeric vector). Different from your API key and secret, you don't need to put it in quote. Now assign the latitude of Julius Nyerere International Airport to variable latitude. The latitude and longitude of the airport is -6.872, 39.206.
  CorrectAnswer: latitude <- -6.872
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='latitude <- -6.872')
  Hint: "Assign the latitude value: -6.872 to a variable called latitude. Type in latitude <- -6.872"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now assign the value of longitude to a variable named longitude. 
  CorrectAnswer: longitude <- 39.206
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='longitude <- 39.206')
  Hint: "Assign the longitude value: -6.872 to a variable called longitude. Type in longitude <- 39.206"

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the third parameter we need to pass to basic weather query?
  AnswerChoices: startDate; endDate; plantDate; Date
  CorrectAnswer: 'startDate'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 'startDate')
  Hint: "The name of parameters spelled in the query must be exactly as they are listed on the aWhere Weather Kit API Documentation. The parameters are: latitude, longitude, and startDate"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Start date must be pass to the API in the format as "YYYY-MM-DD". Now assign the value of start date to a variable named startDate. Just assume the start date is the date of Farmers' Day, "2015-08-08". 
  CorrectAnswer: startDate <- "2015-08-08"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='startDate <- "2015-08-08"')
  Hint: "Assign the start date value: '2015-08-08' to a variable called startDate. Type in startDate <- '2015-08-08'"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now we need to create a query string using all the parameters we have identified. The query string will look like 'latitude=-6.872&longitude=39.206&startDate=2015-08-08'. We will be using paste0 function from R to create an object named strquery. You can type in ?paste to look at the help file
  CorrectAnswer: ?paste
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('?paste', '?"paste"', 'help(paste)', 'help("paste")')
  Hint: Type ?paste to view its help file.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Based on the help file, if we want to create a string that looks like 'latitude=-6.872', we just just need to paste latitude and -6.872 together, seperated by '='. 
  CorrectAnswer: 'paste("latitude", -6.872, sep = "=")'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='paste("latitude", -6.872, sep = "=")')
  Hint: Type paste("latitude", -6.872, sep = "=") to get the string
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To create a string looks like latitude=-6.872&longitude=39.206, we will need to collapse latitude=-6.872 and longitude=39.206 with a & symbol. You can use c("latitude", "longitude") to realize collapse function. 
  CorrectAnswer: 'paste(c("latitude", "longitude"), c(-6.872, 39.206), sep = "=", collapse = "&")'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='paste(c("latitude", "longitude"), c(-6.872, 39.206), sep = "=", collapse = "&")')
  Hint: Type paste(c("latitude", "longitude"), c(-6.872, 39.206), sep = "=", collapse = "&") to get the string

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now create a string with all three parameters and assign it to strquery. 
  CorrectAnswer: 'strquery <- paste(c("latitude", "longitude", "startDate"), c(-6.872, 39.206, "2015-08-08"), sep = "=", collapse = "&")'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='strquery <- paste(c("latitude", "longitude", "startDate"), c(-6.872, 39.206, "2015-08-08"), sep = "=", collapse = "&")')
  Hint: Adding 'startDate' and the value '2015-08-08' to the paste command and assign it to strquery. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Check out the basic weather query string you created and assigned to strquery
  CorrectAnswer: strquery
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='strquery')
  Hint: Just type strquery
  
- Class: text
  Output: Now the third step to retrieve data from weather api is to send a GET requeset. We would rely on a package called 'httr' to do this. 'httr' is designed to provide R functionality to work with modern web APIs. To leverage this package, we will have to install it and load it to the environment. 
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: We have already discussed how to install a package in the previous session. Can you point out which of the following command is wrong?
  AnswerChoices: install.packages(httr); install.packages("httr"); devtools::install_github("hadley/httr"); in cmd prompt or in terminal, type in "R CMD INSTALL httr_1.0.0.tar.gz"
  CorrectAnswer: 'install.packages(httr)'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'install.packages(httr)')
  Hint: The package name iin the install package command has to be in quote. 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: After installing a package, you will have to load it to your environment in order to use it. Now use the library command to load the httr package.
  CorrectAnswer: 'library(httr)'
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('library("httr")', 'library(httr)')
  Hint: Just type library(httr)
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "The command we will be using is GET. GET command has 3 required components: 1) a url where you send your command, in our case it is 'https://api.awhere.com/v1/weather'. Now assign this url to an object named url. "
  CorrectAnswer: 'url <- "https://api.awhere.com/v1/weather" '
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'url <- "https://api.awhere.com/v1/weather"')
  Hint: Assign https://api.awhere.com/v1/weather in quote to url
  
- Class: text
  Output: The second component is your strquery string you have already created in step two.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The third component is your authentication where you will give it your api_key and api_secret where you have already stored your API key and secret. Now pass your api_key and api_secret to authenticate command as two arguments. 
  CorrectAnswer: 'authenticate(api_key, api_secret)'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'authenticate(api_key, api_secret)')
  Hint: Just type in authenticate(api_key, api_secret)
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We know all three components we need to pass to GET command. They are url, strquery, and authenticate. Construct GET query with all three components. Note that strquery has to be passed to query. 
  CorrectAnswer: 'GET(url, query = strquery, authenticate(api_key, api_secret))'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'GET(url, query = strquery, authenticate(api_key, api_secret))')
  Hint: Just type in GET(url, query = strquery, authenticate(api_key, api_secret))

- Class: text
  Output: Great job! Now you have finished your first API call. Look at the result of the API call that R gives out. You can see in Response it gives the url you used to send the GET request. Date indicates the time you sent out for the query. Status is a HTTP status. 200 means OK. You might also see 400 which means bad request. 404 is not found and 500 is internal server error. 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now we want to get weather data out from the content of this API response. To do that, first we have to store the response to an object in R. Assign the result of the GET request to request
  CorrectAnswer: 'request <- GET(url, query = strquery, authenticate(api_key, api_secret))'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'request <- GET(url, query = strquery, authenticate(api_key, api_secret))')
  Hint: Assign the command from the previous question to request using <-
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Now we are at the fourth step: format and export data. We will be using library jsonlite to convert our content. Which of the following command is a correct way to use this library?"
  AnswerChoices: install.package("jsonlite") then library(jsonlite); install.packages(jsonlite) then require(jsonlite); install.packages("jsonlite") then library("jsonlite"); library(jsonlite)
  CorrectAnswer: 'install.packages("jsonlite") then library("jsonlite")'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 'install.packages("jsonlite") then library("jsonlite")')
  Hint: Be careful about the spelling and quotes. require is not a recommended way to load packages. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can check ?content for more help. Passing a request class object to content with as argument as "text", you can get a json string. Type in content(request, as = "text") to see the data query result.
  CorrectAnswer: 'content(request, as = "text")'
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('content(request, as = "text")', 'content(request, "text")')
  Hint: Type in content(request, as = "text")
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Using fromJSON command from jsonlite package, we can decode the request content into a readable format. Try fromJSON with content(request, as = "text") and assign this result to data. 
  CorrectAnswer: 'data <- fromJSON(content(request, as = "text"))'
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('data <- fromJSON(content(request, as = "text"))', 'data <- fromJSON(content(request, "text"))')
  Hint: Be careful about spelling, capital letters, and quote. 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: type in data to see how the data look like
  CorrectAnswer: 'data'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'data')
  Hint: type in data  
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To take data of the weather variables out, we can use R subsetting operators. Try data$dailyAttributes.
  CorrectAnswer: 'data$dailyAttributes'
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('data$dailyAttributes', 'data[, "dailyAttributes"]')
  Hint: Type in data$dailyAttributes
  
- Class: text
  Output: You might have noticed that the weather variables in data all have a prefix "dailyAttributes" while the variables from data$dailyAttributes do not have that prefiix. This was because the aWhere weather data was stored in a nested json format. This nested json format does not compatible with 2 dimensional tabular data format. 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: In order to turn the data output compatible with a tabular format (such as excel), we use data.frame command to "flatten" thhe dataset. Type in data_output <- data.frame(latitude = data$latitude, longitude = data$longitude, date = as.Date(data$date), data$dailyAttributes, stringsAsFactors=FALSE).
  CorrectAnswer: 'data_output <- data.frame(latitude = data$latitude, longitude = data$longitude, date = as.Date(data$date), data$dailyAttributes, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'data_output <- data.frame(latitude = data$latitude, longitude = data$longitude, date = as.Date(data$date), data$dailyAttributes, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)')
  Hint: Just type in data_output <- data.frame(latitude = data$latitude, longitude = data$longitude, date = as.Date(data$date), data$dailyAttributes, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: See how data_output looks like now!
  CorrectAnswer: 'data_output'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'data_output')
  Hint: Just type in data_output
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use ?write.csv, and figure out how to store data_output to a csv file named "weather-data.csv". 
  CorrectAnswer: 'write.csv(data_output, "./weather-data.csv")'
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('write.csv(data_output, "./weather-data.csv")', 'write.csv(data_output, file = "weather-data.csv")', 'write.csv(data_output, file = "./weather-data.csv")', 'write.csv(data_output, "weather-data.csv')
  Hint: Look and try the examples in the end of the help file.
